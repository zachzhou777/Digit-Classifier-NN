# Digit-Classifier-NN
Implemented a neural network to classify handwritten digits.

Proof of Concept - Java implementation of the neural network

Hopes, dreams, and aspirations - Implement neural net in an embedded system containing a touchscreen and have it classify 
digits traced on the screen; use an FPGA to do all the MAC operations (i.e., linear algebra)
