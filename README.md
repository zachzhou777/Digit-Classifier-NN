# Digit-Classifier-NN
Implemented a neural network to classify handwritten digits.

Proof of Concept - Java implementation of the neural network

Hopes, dreams, and aspirations - Implement neural net on the ECE 353 board, i.e., an embedded system controlled by the 
Tiva LaunchPad MCU. Board contains a touchscreen; have it classify digits traced on the screen. Use the DE0-Nano FPGA 
board, the board I used in ECE 551, to train the network.
